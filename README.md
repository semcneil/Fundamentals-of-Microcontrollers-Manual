# Manual for the Fundamentals of Applied Microcontrollers class

The basic layout of the project was inspired by Pat Morin's [Open Data Structures](https://github.com/patmorin/ods) book.

## Assembling the manual
If everything is setup correctly, running `make` in the main directory should generate
`manual.pdf` in the `latex` directory.
