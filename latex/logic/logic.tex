\section{Introduction}
This chapter introduces some basic Boolean logic including gates and Boolean algebra.

How do you start a car? In the cars I have driven I have to press on the break at the 
same time as I turn the key. To say it another way, the car starts when I press the break
AND turn the key.
\begin{equation}
	pressBreak \: \mathrm{AND} \: turnKey = startedCar
\end{equation}
Again on a car, a blinker will turn on if you turn on the turn signal or if you turn on the 4-way blinker.
\begin{equation}
	turnSignal \: \mathrm{OR} \: 4wayBlinker = blinking
\end{equation}
The AND and OR in the equation are Boolean operators. 

\section{Methods of Representing Logic}
It is important to differentiate between different forms of representation because $\overline{\mathrm{EN}}$
means \textbf{active low} enable. It does not mean NOT(E AND N). The understanding of which method is being 
used is usually derived from context. Using the dot ($\cdot$) everywhere can become burdensome, so when context
makes it obvious (usually examples involving A, B, and C or X and Y) we may drop the dots and just use adjacency to represent
the AND function.

\section{Boolean Algebra}

\subsection{Theorems of Boolean Algebra}
Ways to show NOT:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
	NOT(X) &= \overline{X} = X^{\prime} \\
	\overline{(\overline{X})} &= \left(X^{\prime}\right)^{\prime}= X
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Rules of AND and OR:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
	\mathrm{AND} \qquad & \mathrm{OR}\notag\\
	0\cdot0 = 0 \qquad & 1+1 = 1\\
	1\cdot1 = 1 \qquad & 0+0 = 0\\
	0\cdot1 = 1\cdot0 = 0 \qquad & 1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
	\mathrm{AND} \qquad & \mathrm{OR}\notag\\
	X\cdot1 = X \qquad & X + 0 = X\\	
	X\cdot0 = 0 \qquad & X + 1 = 1\\	
	X\cdot X = X \qquad & X + X = X\\	
	X\cdot\overline{X} = X \qquad & X + \overline{X} = 1\\
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
