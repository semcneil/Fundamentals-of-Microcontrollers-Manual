\section{Introduction}
This chapter introduces students to using buttons and serial communications.

\section{Buttons}

A typical button circuit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:buttonPullup}. The input is high until the button is pressed.
Unfortunately, being mechanical, buttons do not always create nice, clean switched inputs as is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:buttonDebounce}. Maxim Integrated has a 
\href{https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/2/287.html}{nice paper} on the topic
advertizing their devices to solve the problem. However, if we don't have the option of adding their hardware, some 
work can be done in software to debounce an input. As Maxim mentions, software debouncing is not free. It does incur
some overhead so you probably do not want to do it for many inputs. An example of software debouncing is in 
Listing \ref{lst:debounce}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={This is the Arduino example of software debouncing.},label={lst:debounce}]
	/*
	Debounce
  
	Each time the input pin goes from LOW to HIGH (e.g. because of a push-button
	press), the output pin is toggled from LOW to HIGH or HIGH to LOW. There's a
	minimum delay between toggles to debounce the circuit (i.e. to ignore noise).
  
	The circuit:
	- LED attached from pin 13 to ground through 220 ohm resistor
	- pushbutton attached from pin 2 to +5V
	- 10 kilohm resistor attached from pin 2 to ground
  
	- Note: On most Arduino boards, there is already an LED on the board connected
	  to pin 13, so you don't need any extra components for this example.

		// only toggle the LED if the new button state is HIGH
		if (buttonState == HIGH) {
		  ledState = !ledState;
		}
	  }
	}
  
	// set the LED:

	// save the reading. Next time through the loop, it'll be the lastButtonState:

\section{Serial Communications}
Serial communications sends data one bit at a time from one device to another as shown in Figure \ref{fig:serial}. This is in 
contrast to parallel communications where multiple bits (8 in the example) are transferred simultaneously between devices as 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:parallel}. As can be seen parallel communications is much faster than serial since you can send 
so many bits simultaneously. However, parallel requires many more pins on each device to communicate. This is challenging in 
the embedded systems world since most microcontrollers don't have many pins. Also, connectors with many pins tend to fail 
more often than connectors with fewer pins. Because of these reasons, the embedded world communicates primarily with serial 
protocols.

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{This is a list of some of the more common serial protocols. The grayed out protocols will not be discussed further.}
	\label{table:serialTypes}
\end{table}

\subsection{Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter}
The Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) protocol has been around quite a while. Older computers used to ship with
serial ports that used this protocol, usually implemented as the RS-232 protocol. UARTs are used to communicate between two devices.
It does not allow for more than two devices. It is full duplex and communicates over 2 wires (plus a ground for reference). 
One wire transmits data from Device 1 to Device 2 and is connected to Device 1's TX pin and Device 2's RX pin. The second wire 
transmits data from Device 2 to Device 1 and is connected to Device 1's RX pin and Device 2's TX pin. This is illustrated in 
Figure \ref{fig:uart}. This protocol does require both devices to use the same specified transmission speed. Some common speeds
are 9600, 14,400, 57,600, and 115,200. It can go faster. Nowadays, it is generally best to go as fast as possible so that
the communications takes less of the processor's time. The most common speed used now seems to be 115,200. The asynchronous 
part of the name comes from the fact that there is no clock line for UARTs. It typically has a maximum speed of 1.5 megabits 
per second (Mbps).

UART is the protocol used to communicate between the computer and your Arduino board. You can see this in the code 
in the setup function where \lstinline{Serial.begin(115200)} or \lstinline{Serial.begin(9600)} shows up often.

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{A UART has full duplex between two entities.}
	\label{fig:uart}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Serial Peripheral Interface}
The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a full-duplex serial interface shown in Figure \ref{fig:spi}. It is setup in a controller-peripheral 
(previously known as master-slave) architecture with only one controller on the bus. It does allow for multiple 
peripherals by giving each peripheral its own chip select (CS) line. Since it is synchronous, it does require a
clock line. This means that it takes a minimum of 4 wires as listed in Table \ref{table:spiwires}. The SCLK signal is the
clock signal used by both the controller and peripheral. There is one CS line per peripheral. The CS line lets the controller 
specify which peripheral it is communicating with. The COPI line is the data going from the controller to the peripheral. 
The CIPO line is the data going from the peripheral to the controller. 

SPI has a maximum data rate of 60 Mbps, which is the fastest of the 3 protocols commonly used in the embedded world. Because of 
this, it is used in more data intense situations like SD Cards (where we will be using it) and displays.

\subsection{Inter-Integrated Circuit}
The Inter-Integrated Circuit (I\textsuperscript{2}C, IIC, or I2C) protocol is multi-controller and multi-peripheral. Basically,
any device connected to the bus can drive the communication. It is single ended so data only flows one way at a time. It only 
requires 3 wires, SCL - clock, SDA - Data, and a ground reference. SCL and SDA do require pull-up resistors so that devices
only have to pull the lines to ground to communicate as shown in Figure \ref{fig:i2c}. Instead of using chip select lines 
like SPI, I2C requires each peripheral to have a unique address. I2C addresses for modules that are on the board or may be 
used with the board can be seen in Table \ref{table:i2caddresses}. I2C has a max speed of 3.4 Mbps but is only 100 kbps in 
standard mode.

\section{In Case of Upload Lock-up or Failure}
If the Arduino IDE is having trouble uploading to the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect, try double pressing
(not too fast) the reset button on the Nano once the IDE starts trying to upload.

\section{Arduino Programming Suggestions}
In general, try to start from an existing set of code (an example for instance) when working on something.
For example, if you need to use the APDS-9960, load one of the examples from the library, then modify it
until it does what you want. Once you have written a few sketches, you might write a generic starting point
for your subsequent sketches.

\section{Arduino Button Setup}
An example of how to setup the buttons on the CEC 325 board. Some important details to note is that the left button 
is attached to pin D9 (referred to as 9 in the Arduino infrastructure) which is attached to the RP2040 on the
Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect module. The RP2040 has internal pull-up resistors that are tied correctly to the 
Arduino IDE so that the pins can be setup using \lstinline@pinMode(LEFT_BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);@ and do not
require an external pull-up resistor. The right button is attached to pin A7 on the module which is routed to the
WiFiNINA module. This module's internal pull-up is not implemented in the Arduino IDE (as of 2022 February 03). 
Therefore, it needs an external pull-up AND requires the sketch to include "WiFiNINA.h" AND the pin variable 
HAS to be declared using \lstinline@#define@ rather than a \lstinline@const int@.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={This is an example of how to setup the buttons on the CEC 325 board.},label={lst:buttons}]

#include "WiFiNINA.h"  // for A4-A7 and wifi/bluetooth

#define LEFT_BUTTON_PIN   9 // This input is on the RP2040 and has builtin pullup that works
#define RIGHT_BUTTON_PIN  A7 // This input is on the WiFiNINA and doesn't have working internal pullup

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  //while(!Serial) delay(10);
  delay(2000);

  Serial.println("Starting...");

  pinMode(LEFT_BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(RIGHT_BUTTON_PIN, INPUT);
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // note that the buttons read 1 (HIGH or true) when not pressed
  if(!digitalRead(LEFT_BUTTON_PIN)) {
    Serial.println("Left button pushed");
  }
  if(!digitalRead(RIGHT_BUTTON_PIN)) {
    Serial.println("Right button pushed");
  }
  delay(100); // keeps the loop from running too fast with nothing pushed
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Arduino Serial Setup}
The serial port has to be setup in the \lstinline@setup()@ function in the Arduino IDE. An example of setting it up 
is shown in Listing \ref{lst:serial}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={This is an example of how to start the serial port at 112,500 in the Arduino system.},label={lst:serial}]
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); // starts the serial connection at 115200 data (baud) rate
  // If you are attached to a computer (not a robot on battery power
  while(!Serial) delay(10); // wait for serial to start
  // delay(2000);  // if might be on battery, just wait a bit for it to start
  Serial.println("Starting...");

}

void loop() {
  Serial.println("This has a new line character at the end");
  Serial.print("This does not have a new line at the end: ");
  Serial.println(millis());
  delay(5000);
}
\end{lstlisting}
I strongly suggest having the \lstinline@setup()@ function output to the serial port right after the serial port is started 
so that you can know that your board has booted. Note that if you do not have a serial port (your robot is running off of 
batteries so that it is not plugged into a computer) you need to remove the \lstinline@while(!Serial) delay(10)@ line and 
replace it with some sort of timeout function. A \lstinline@delay(2000)@ is usually sufficient to allow the serial to start 
if it exists but not hang if it doesn't. There are more complicated ways to do this, but that will be left as an exercise 
for the reader.
